Spatial Window Switcher
=======================

Description
-----------

Spatial Window Switcher (sws) is a simple tool to switch between open windows
according their spatial placement. It allows you to switch to window to the
left, right, above or below the active window. It works across multiple monitors
and multiple desktops.

Usage
-----

The best way to use this tool is to map it to global keyboard shortcuts of your
desktop environment:

| Action                            | Command     |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Switch to the window to the right | `sws right` |
| Switch to the window to the left  | `sws left`  |
| Switch to the window above        | `sws above` |
| Switch to the window below        | `sws below` |

For example, in Ubuntu, open up the Keyboard settings, switch to the Shortcuts
tab, go to Custom Shortcuts. Then Click the `+` button on the bottom and add
each one of the the above actions. Then assign then shortcuts according to your
preference.

Requirements
------------

This tool is written for linux. It depends on [wmctrl](http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/),
xprop (part of X Window system) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Limitations
-----------

The spatial searching algorithm is currently very simplictic and in might not
switch to the expected window. This will improve in the future.
